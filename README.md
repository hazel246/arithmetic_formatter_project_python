# Arithmetic Arranger

## Overview
This project was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum to complete certification requirements. It formats and arranges arithmetic problems for display, supporting addition and subtraction operations.

## Features
- Accepts up to 5 arithmetic problems at a time.
- Supports addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) operators.
- Validates input for errors, including:
  - Problems exceeding 5.
  - Non-digit numbers.
  - Numbers with more than four digits.
  - Unsupported operators.
- Optionally displays answers to the problems.

## Description
The **Arithmetic Arranger** is a Python program that formats and validates arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction), ensuring they meet specified constraints. It also optionally displays the answers. This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. ðŸ§®

## Input and Output

### Input:
The program accepts a list of arithmetic problems as strings. Each problem must be in the format:  
`<operand1> <operator> <operand2>`

For example:
```python
["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"]
Output:
The program arranges the problems in a neat, readable format. If the show_answers parameter is set to True, it also displays the answers.

For example:

   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
If show_answers=True, the output includes the answers:

   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
  730      3799      88      172
